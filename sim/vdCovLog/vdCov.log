Limited Design Loaded: 
Warning-[UCAPI-LDAST] Limited design loaded
  Only the design information inferred from assertion database is available 
  since the information containing the full compile-time design is not 
  available in the base coverage directory 'merged_dir.vdb'. The report 
  contains only a partial hierarchy - the parts containing assertions - but 
  all coverage scores are correct.
  This situation can sometimes happen if you have only assertion coverage 
  enabled. If you need the full hierarchical report, you have to use at least 
  one '-cm' option at compile-time.
The design 'merged_dir.vdb' was loaded successfully.
The following test is loaded from "merged_dir.vdb",
    merged_dir/merged_test
